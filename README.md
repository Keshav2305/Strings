|---------|---------------------|
| A string is a class that defines objects that be represented as a stream of characters | A character array is simply an array of characters that can be terminated by a null character |
| String class defines a number of functionalities that allow manifold operations on strings | Character arrays do not offer many inbuilt functions to manipulate strings |
